# Object Oriented Programming Labs

Welcome to the Object Oriented Programming Labs repository for the course [Course Code: 202302-IGS2130-001].

## Course Overview
This course focuses on teaching object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and practical implementation skills using the C++ programming language. Designed for students already familiar with procedural programming in C++, the course covers fundamental OOP features such as classes, inheritance, and operator overloading. The laboratory exercises and programming assignments are crafted to reinforce understanding through hands-on practice.

## Labs Overview
This repository contains the laboratory assignments completed during the course. Each lab tackles problems relevant to the themes covered in class, allowing students to apply OOP principles to real-world scenarios. Through these labs, students gain practical experience in designing and implementing C++ classes for various applications.

Feel free to explore the labs and delve into the solutions provided. We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for learning and mastering object-oriented programming concepts in C++.
